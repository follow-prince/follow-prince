<h2> Who I am 🤔❓</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 900;">
Hi there! I'm a student, developer, and volunteer. I believe that personal growth and learning are essential for success, and I have dedicated my life to achieving both. Because of that, I'm always looking to learn new things and apply them to whatever I'm doing. Technology is always igniting my passion for the positive impact it can have, and I'm excited to continue growing my skills and knowledge, so I started my career as a techie. In addition to my studies, I'm also passionate about giving back to various communities and helping others, which is why I volunteer my time to help out whenever I can, and I believe that this work is vital in helping to create a better future for everyone.
